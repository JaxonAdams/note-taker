## Description
This note taking app uses an Express.js backend to store notes and make them accessable from different machines. I do occasionally use this for my personal notes, so feel free to poke around and mess with the features, but please be professional when it comes to leaving notes.

The front-end of this project was provided by the University of Utah Professional Education Coding Boot Camps. I added a few minor tweaks to the design to make it a little nicer on mobile.
